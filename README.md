# 257 Portal
257 Portal is a small aplication for my hometown and i started developing it just a few week ago, this app is like most of the news app and will contain all relevant data about place.
At this stage there is not very much things implemented in the app but but these are things which I will implement over time. This app is based on modern Android application tech-stacks, and MVVM architecture and also this app is made in single activity multiple fragments design pattern. App is stil in a process of making.
  - Information about sport events
  - Part of the app where all notices will be available
  - Information about all fun events and doings
  - There will also be a marketplace where people will sell their stuff
  - Part of the app where weather will be displayed
  - Searching through databse to find needed data
  - And there will also be a section where readers can enter their own articles

# About
At this point the app consists of Navigation Drawer and Bottom Navigation Drawer and when I clik on any of their items app sends me to the specific fragment. App consists of fragments for general news, sport news, notices, news about fun events a there is also implemented that users of this app can also add their own story. When clicked on any of items in RecyclerView app sends us to detail fragment where we see much more information about the specific piece of news. Also this app has implemented functionality that when long pressed we can update or delete specific item. This app is still in process of making so there will be more features in future.

# Architecture
The architecture of the application is based, apply and strictly complies with each of the following 5 points:
- A single-activity architecture
- Android architecture components, part of Android Jetpack for give to project a robust design, testable and maintainable.
- Pattern Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) facilitating a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
- S.O.L.I.D design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.
- Modular app architecture allows to be developed features in isolation, independently from other features.
