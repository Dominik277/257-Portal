# 257 Portal
257 Portal is a small aplication for my hometown and i started developing it just a week ago, this app is like most of the news app and will contain all relevant data about place.
At this stage there is not very much things implemented in the app but but these are things which I will implement over time
  - Information about sport events
  - Part of the app where all notices will be available
  - Information about all fun events and doings
  - There will also be a marketplace where people will sell their stuff
  - Part of the app where weather will be displayed
  - Searching through databse to find needed data
  - And there will also be a section where readers can enter their own articles
